# Ace Battle Mile platforms

> Welcome to the official repository for Ace Battle Mile, an innovative team running game that combines strategy, speed, and teamwork. Here, teams of 5 to 7 runners compete head-to-head, with their collective mile times determining the outcome of each race. The introduction of "Jokers" – special team members with the ability to replace runners mid-race – adds a thrilling strategic element.
